Class 1- Multiple Linear Regression in R
What is Multiple Linear Regression
Do a scatterplot- tells you if variables are related.
It could be positive or negative linear. 
y= a + b1x1 + b2x2 +...

Using vehicle data-
labour cost = a + b1(labour hours) + b2(mileage)
If suppose mileage is not really significant it can be dropped off.

lc= 1.375+ -0.0000847*mileage + 73.55*lh

Probability value in summary is the most important. Shows the significance.
Mileage is not playing a role. 
Delete it from further analysis.

p-value= 0.001
(1-p)= 1-0.001= 0.999 or 99.99 percent
more than 95% is really good
labour hour is really significant
Confidence level for mileage is 1-0.2= 0.8, so 80% confidence.
Individual variables values

F-Statistic
P-values below- 1- small no.
R Square- 
Multiple R-Squared- 0.951- contributes 95% to variability. 2% or so, no variability. Remaining 5% is the part that can be addressed by other variables. 
Adjusted R-Squared- 

lc= -0.236 +73.5088lh
