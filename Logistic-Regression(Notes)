Class 2- Logistic Regression in R
What is Logistic Regression
Goal for this class is to classify student applications as admit or reject.
The target or dependent variable is Admit (0- no, 1- yes)
Predictors or independent variables are GRE, GPA and Rank.
Dependent- Not continuous, but only categorical.

A two way table of factor variables is made to ensure that cells do not have zero values.

ln(p/1-p)= a+ b1x1+ b2x2+ .....bnxn= y
p-- probability of accepting
1-p-- probability of rejecting
ln(p/1-p)= y
p/1-p= eˆy, p= eˆy/1+eˆy

Equation using final model.
ln(p/1-p)= y= -4.727 + 1.3735*gpa + -.5712*rank2 + -1.1645*rank3 + -1.5642*rank4
When we want to write the equation for rank 1, then last three terms will become zero. If we want to write rank 3, rank 2 and rank 4 will become zero.

For the first candidate, the gpa is 3.61 and rank is 3. So, y= -4.727 + 1.3735*3.61 + -1.1645*1
y= -0.933165 (if you don't put type= "response", this is what you get)
p= e^-0.933165/1+ e^-0.933165
p= 0.2822 (this is what you get when you put type= "response")

For students coming from rank 3 and 4 schools, the coefficient of rank is more negative indicating that if the rank is lower, the odds of the student getting accepted is much lower.
The gpa is positive. So, it means possibility of admission goes up with getting a better gpa.

Confusion Matrix shows correct classifications along the diagonal.

Goodness of fit???
